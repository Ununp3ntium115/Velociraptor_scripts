.SYNOPSIS
    Investigate the missing artifact pack issue and test our enhanced tool manager

.DESCRIPTION
    This script will:
    1. Check Velociraptor release assets for artifact pack availability
    2. Test our enhanced artifact tool manager
    3. Validate offline collector functionality
    4. Provide recommendations for improvements
