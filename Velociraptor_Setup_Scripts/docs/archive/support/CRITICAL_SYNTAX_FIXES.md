# Critical GUI Syntax Fixes - RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. PowerShell Syntax Errors
**Problem**: Broken comment syntax causing PowerShell to interpret text as commands
- Line 240: `Create` command not recognized
- Line 385: `Create` command not recognized  
- Line 563: `idate` command not recognized

**Root Cause**: Comments were formatted as `}#` followed by text on the next line, which PowerShell interpreted as separate commands.

**Solution**: Fixed all broken comment patterns:
```powershell
# BEFORE (Broken)
}#
Create modern progress panel

# AFTER (Fixed)  
}

# Create modern progress panel
```

### 2. Branding Update
**Change**: Replaced "Professional Edition" with "Free For All First Responders"

**Locations Updated**:
- Console banner display
- GUI version label in header

**Before**:
```
║                      Professional Edition                     ║
v5.0.1 | Professional Edition
```

**After**:
```
║                  Free For All First Responders               ║
v5.0.1 | Free For All First Responders
```
