Write-Host @"

To run the working GUI:

   1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
   2. Navigate to this directory
   3. Run: .\VelociraptorGUI-Actually-Working.ps1

Expected behavior:
• GUI opens without errors
• Path validation works with color feedback
• Installation actually downloads and configures Velociraptor
• Web interface becomes accessible after installation
• Credentials are provided for access
