- `tech.md` - Complete technology stack, development environment, and tooling
- `structure.md` - Detailed project structure, organization, and naming conventions
- `testing.md` - Comprehensive testing guidelines, quality assurance, and CI/CD

### Specialized Guidance
- `velociraptor-source.md` - Custom Velociraptor repository configuration and usage guidelines

## Steering System Features

### Automatic Context Inclusion
These files are automatically included in agent context to provide:
- **Project Background**: Complete understanding of project objectives and scope
- **Technical Constraints**: Technology requirements, compatibility, and limitations

- **Architecture Guidance**: Project structure, module organization, and design patterns

### Quick Reference System
The steering system includes:
- **INDEX.md** - Quick reference to all active steering documents
- **SHORTHAND.md** - Code-based reference system for easy lookup in code and documentation
- **Cross-References** - Integrated reference system across all documentation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development
- Reference steering files when making architectural decisions
- Follow technology stack guidelines for tool selection
- Adhere to structure conventions for new files and modules
- Implement testing standards for all new functionality

### For Documentation
- Use shorthand codes for cross-referencing (e.g., [TECH], [SECU], [TEST])
- Follow documentation standards and organization patterns
- Maintain consistency with established terminology and concepts

### For Quality Assurance
- Validate against testing guidelines and coverage requirements
- Ensure compliance with security and deployment standards
- Follow release and versioning procedures
